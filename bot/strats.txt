I) 

1. Find out average number of falls and rises.

2. Buy just before the end of avg falls.

3. Sell just before end of avg rises.


II) Run FB prophet and try short term prediction


III) 

1. Calculate multiple technical indicators in a single update

2. Chose BUY if all signals indicate BUY

3. Chose SELL if all signals indicate SELL

IV) Using reinforcement learning or real time ML strategies for optimising next move


V) Create combinations matrix against financial instruments. 





Guidelines

a) 

1. Run the trends for multiple stocks / crypts / commodities (financial instruments) and check 
which of them are following the signals which we measure


b)

1. Check which stocks have grown highest in the day (Top gainers), try using 
algorithms specifically only for those

c) Result analysis

Check what happens if stock went down over a period of time,
stock remained on same level, stock moved with index fund (I think should be the baseline),
stock increased over time (would be baseline for that particular stock).
Check the model performance for all these combinations of movement types

How to calculate alpha? What is alpha?

d) How does commission affect the returns? 


* It's important to combine multiple above strategies to check which will give 
return.

* Using previous data testing and analysing is crucial here.

* Shorting strategies usually beat the market (?)
